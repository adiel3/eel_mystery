        <p>Every few months, a very specific thought reoccurs to me: did someone really dump 100 saltwater eels into the 
            Prospect Park lake in September 2020?</p>
        <p>The thing is, I know they did. But the event is so surreal, every time I remember it, I second guess myself, 
            despite lots of evidence it happened. There were dozens of <a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/eels-dumped-prospect-park-lake/">news articles</a> 
            quoting city Parks Department officials and multiple witnesses, and even <a href="https://x.com/nmap1011/status/1310785493597065216">a video</a></a>
             of a man confronting the eel dumper mid-act.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hereâ€™s a trimmed clip of the video; my husband is the one recording.

        <p>"That's like 100 eels," he said in disbelief, "that's illegal." To which the eel dumper responded "I save their lives." Bizzare stuff.</p>

        <p>I thought it was a one-off, but less than two years later, another illegal dumping in Prospect Park made news - this time, a 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/20/nyregion/alligator-prospect-park-brooklyn.html">"lethargic" and "emaciated" alligator</a> 
            that had likely been illegally kept as a pet. It was sent to the Bronx Zoo for rehabilitation, but 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/nyregion/alligator-prospect-park-dies.html">died two months later.</a></p>

        <p>Prospect Park isn't that large a place. And it's not a natural habitat for eels and alligators. So I began to wonder: 
            just how unusual were these incidents anyway? And what other bizarre animal incidents are happening in New York City? </p>

        <p>It turns out, there's data for that.</p>

        <h2>Who you gonna call?</h2>
        <p>When there's an animal in need of assistance, relocation or rescue in a New York City park, it's the Department of Parks 
            and Recreation's <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers">urban park rangers</a> who respond. They've responded 
            to over 5,000 calls since 2018, when they began publishing data. The largest portion of the calls come from department employees, 
            but nearly as many come from the general public. Between 2018 and June 2023, rangers classified <b>22 percent</b> of 
            reports as unfounded.</p>

        <p></p>

        <iframe title="Reported animal incidents in New York City parks" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-H0VOL" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/H0VOL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="446" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p></p>
        
        <p>Most calls were about injured or unhealthy animals. <b>12.6 percent</b> of calls were for animals "dead on arrival." But I wanted 
            to know what kind of weird animals were being reported.</p>

        <p>Just <b>7.2 percent</b> of the calls were about invasive or exotic animals. The rate 
            of unfounded calls was lower than average for invasive species, but much higher for exotic ones, at <b>33 percent</b>.</p>
        
        <P>Nearly half of exotic animal reports citywide were for terrestrial reptiles or amphibians, including multiple pythons and bearded dragons 
            (some unfounded, some real). No exotic fish were reported, but nearly <b>38 percent</b> of invasive species were reptiles or fish.</P>

        <p>But when I began to look through those reports for specific species and incidents, I discovered something strange.</p>

        <p>I couldn't find the eels.</p>

        <p></p>

        <iframe title="Exotic and invasive animals reported in Prospect Park" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-lO7nJ" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lO7nJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="328" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p></p>

        <p>There were eels in the data. Just not in Prospect Park. Only two eel incidents appeared in the database, both in Flushing Meadows 
            Corona Park, for a far lower number of reported eels.</p>

        <p></p>

        <iframe title="Number of eels dumped per incident" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-yykBf" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yykBf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="486" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
        
        <p></p>

        <p>But the missing Prospect Park eels are very strange, as it was a high-profile eel incident. The Parks Department was quoted in multiple 
            articles about the eels in the weeks following the illegal dumping, while neither Flushing Meadows Corona Park eel incident made headlines.</p>

        <p>The Prospect Park emaciated alligator from 2023, which also made headlines, was in the database (along with a live alligator in a Staten Island 
            park in 2019 and a dead one in a Queens park in 2021), further deepening the mystery.</p>

        <p>I reached out to the Parks Department for clarification on why this large dump of eels does not appear in its data. The agency did not immediately 
            respond to the request for comment.</p>

        <h2>The eels are not alone</h2>

        <p>While I waited to hear back, I began exploring some of the other reports of invasive and exotic species.</p>

        <p>Many, but not all, of the most bizarre reports proved unfounded. There was an exotic species subcategory for "Rare, Endangered, Dangerous" animals, whose 
            only entry was an unfounded report of a puma on Staten Island. There were also unfounded reports of a wildcat, two bearded dragons, 
            a chinchilla, a handful of snakes, and a dead sea turtle.</p>

        <p>Most of the city's unfounded reports of exotic and invasive species came from Central and Prospect Park.</p>

        <p></p>

        <iframe title="Parks with the most unfounded reports of invasive and exotic species" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-r8bIa" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r8bIa/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="631" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p></p>

        <p>But far more intriguing were the reports that proved true. The majority of them were for birds, but most of the exotic ones were reptiles, 
            amphibians or marine animals. These included:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>two green iguanas</li>
            <li>three American alligators (mentioned above)</li>
            <li>two bearded dragons</li>
            <li>a ball python</li>
            <li>a boa constrictor</li>
            <li>many, many turtles</li>
            <li>and, of course, two groups of eels</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many of these were found dead, injured or unhealthy. But not all.</p>

        <p></p>

        <iframe title="Health of reptiles and amphibians found in parks" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-NkQHU" 
            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NkQHU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" 
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="516" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p></p>

        <p>Among the healthy animals found were an alligator, a bearded dragon, and a boa constrictor. I could find no 
            news reports about any of these significant animal incidents, though a few months earlier a Staten Island couple 
            <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/23/cops-capture-alligator-believed-to-be-a-pet-on-staten-island/">captured and taped shut</a> 
            the mouth of an alligator they spotted in the same park. That incident was not in the dataset, perhaps because police may have handled
            the incident without calling in the urban park rangers, based on news reports.</p>

        <p>So, at the end of this exploration, instead of answering my eel-related inquiries, I find I only have more questions:</p> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>What's the criteria for an animal incident in a New York City park making it into this database?</li>
            <li>How many bizarre animal incidents might be missing?</li>
            <li>How was there a healthy boa constrictor loose in Pelham Bay Park in 2022? Any why on Earth did that not make news?</li>
        </ul>
